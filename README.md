# Login
In real launch, the application will be a login only access. This is done so users who view content would be able to interact with other users after account creation. 
# Home
The homepage offers a variety of subfeatures. New members are shown on the right to increase interactivity between members. The left sidebar showcases some of the tabs that are included in V1.

# Users
The users tab is a simple feature that showcases all the new users that are being created. This is a larger scale implementation of the subfeature on the home page.

# Profile
Every user will have a profile that lets them create their own identity. Following their quirky biography, they will also showcase their posts on the website. Further updates would expand the profile page to showcase their posts.
